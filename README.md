# Advanced TypeScript - education course for mad

We are going to create CLI tool for managing a catalog of products. 
The catalog will be hosted on the local computer in SQLite DB, so there will be no server-client interaction. 
All the operations over the catalog will be performed using Ink — React-based tool for building modern CLI interactions.

## Commands
`--help`

Call of the script output white text "This is a product catalog software ©"

`--version` 

Call of output the version from package.json.
